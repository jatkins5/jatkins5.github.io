<p>This paper investigates a fundamental question in planetary science: how do moons form from the debris disks created by giant impacts? When a Mars-sized object collided with the early Earth billions of years ago, it created a disk of vaporized rock that would eventually coalesce into our Moon. But the exact mechanism by which tiny particles in this disk grew into a massive satellite has remained unclear.</p>

<p>We explored whether the streaming instability—a process where interactions between gas and solid particles create dense clumps that can gravitationally collapse—played a significant role in this process. The streaming instability has been successful in explaining how kilometer-sized planetesimals form in protoplanetary disks around young stars, so it seemed like a natural candidate for moon formation as well.</p>

<p>Using detailed hydrodynamic simulations, we found that the conditions in moon-forming disks are actually quite hostile to the streaming instability. The key issue is that these disks are much hotter and more compact than protoplanetary disks, with temperatures reaching thousands of degrees near the planet. This extreme heat causes the gas to be less dense relative to the solid particles, which weakens the aerodynamic coupling needed for the instability to operate.</p>

<p>Our results suggest that moons likely form through a different pathway—direct pairwise collisions between particles that gradually build up larger bodies. This has important implications for understanding not just our own Moon, but also the diverse satellite systems we observe around gas giants and the potential moons of exoplanets.</p>
