I am a software engineer at [Lido](https://www.lido.app/). I'm broadly interested in applying technology to unsolved scientific problems, especially in physics & astronomy.

Before joining Lido, I was an undergrad at the University of Rochester, where I graduated with a dual degree in Physics & Astronomy and Math and a minor in CS.
